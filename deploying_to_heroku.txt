quick guide for exiting git repo
	https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4#local-workstation-setup

	Use a Procfile in the root directory to dictate specific commands

	Almost every deploy to Heroku follows this same pattern.
	First, add the modified files to the local git repository:
	$ git add .

	Now commit the changes to the repository:
	$ git commit -m "Demo"

	Now deploy, just as you did previously:
	$ git push heroku master

	Finally, check that everything is working:
	$ heroku open

Key Commands

	heroku logs <tags>
	heroku logs --tail
	# must Ctrl+C to stop

	heroku addons 
	# see addons e.g. postgres DB manager

	heroku config
	# show config vars

	heroku run <cmd>
	heroku run rake db:migrate
	# run a particular commmand in a one-off dyno process
